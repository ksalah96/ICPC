U. Is B a subsequence of A ?
a sub sequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

IF array = [1,6,3 , 7] then the some subsequences are [1,3,7] , [6,7] , [1] , [6,3,7] , [1,7] .

Something like [3,1] and [6 , 7 , 1] would not be sub sequences of the array [1,6,3 , 7].

Given 2 numbers N
, M and 2 arrays A consists of N numbers and B consists of M numbers. Determine whether B is a sub-sequence of A

or not.

Note: The array B
is called a sub-sequence of A if it's possible to remove zero or some elements from A to get B

.

For example: if A
=[1,4,7], and B is [1], [1,4], [1,7],[1,4,7] or [4,7] then B is a sub-sequence of A.
